# EatWell

The goal of our final project is to help everyone to maintain a balanced diet by calculating the calories and nutrients in everything you eat. With our application, you would be able to input what you eat throughout the day and this will show you how many calories you have eaten, as well as nutrients you might be missing. This application will give you other food items you can eat to fill in the missing nutrition. The motivation for this project is to help everyone eat their required nutrients everyday to stay healthy. Especially us college students, many eat what they might find cheap and good but may not always be the correct choice. We want people to know what they are eating to help maintain a balanced diet.
